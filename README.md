# Ainu Language & Cultural Identity: A Visual Exploration

This project is a final presentation for the course **CORE 4990 â€“ Endangered Languages & Cultural Identity** at St. John Fisher University. It explores the endangered **Ainu language**, the rich cultural heritage of the Ainu people in Hokkaido, and the revitalization efforts to preserve their linguistic and cultural identity. The project is presented as an interactive, scroll-based web poster using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.

## Project Overview

- The **linguistic profile** of the Ainu language  
- The **cultural significance** of language among the Ainu community  
- The **historical and modern challenges** leading to language loss  
- **Revitalization efforts** through education, media, and legal recognition
